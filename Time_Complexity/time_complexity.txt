Time Complexity and Space Complexity

-> Time taken by a machine to process that code 😑 ❌ because each system takes different time based on its hardware config.
-> TC: The rate at which time taken increases/decreases wrt input size.  
- Its not measured in terms of seconds or ms, instead it is measured in notations such as:
1. O() ie. (big o)
2.
